## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS flex
### What I learned

The image centered and kept in a block
img {
      display: block;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
      width: 90%;
      border-radius: 10px;
    }
Really learned how to use the UI/UX design and knowed the structure of html 

### Continued development

I'll focuse in the design and how to style it and see the tree of html components
r own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) - This helped me for centering the image and scaling it . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
